 * The basemap style, ours, derived from OpenFreeMap's published pair.

 *   pnpm run map:style            # rebuild from the cached copies -- offline, free
 *   pnpm run map:style --fetch    # re-download the published styles first
 *
 * Writes `src/data/map-style-light.json` and `-dark.json`; change the tables below and
 * re-run rather than editing the JSON. Built once rather than patched at runtime because
 * the published colours painted first and ours a frame later, an endpoint that changed
 * shape left the app with no map, and an id that never existed was forgiven as quietly as
 * one upstream had renamed (the two styles name their layers differently, and the dark
 * adjustments never once applied to the light map). Here a wrong id refuses to build.
 *
 * Tiles, sprites and glyphs still come from tiles.openfreemap.org, so the CSP gains no
 * origin; the layers stay as published, in their published order, with one of ours on top
 * (LANDMARKS). The measurements behind every value are in design/DECIDIDO.md.
 *
 * Street names stay at every zoom. They faded out from 15 to 16.5, where the stop names
 * arrive, and a reader zoomed in to find a stop could not read the street it was on.
